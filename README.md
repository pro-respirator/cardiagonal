ethereum based vehicle management and licensing system
this badly named project is a smart contract based equivalent to a combination of carfax and DMV records. It allows users to interact with the contract for some tasks to take load off the real world administration system of institution deploying it. It has a granular administration system that can be used to grant powers for specific tasks to many different agents within the system, helping to cut down on opportunities for corruption. It also includes a system for tracking incidents of damage(by insurance companies or police) and service (by owners or approved services vendors) to a vehicle as well as facilitating and tracking changes of ownership or assignment of vehicles within the system. There is no front-end yet but I intend to add one
